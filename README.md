# Network-routing-algorithms
Objectives: 1. Generate graphs using different data structures - heaps, linked lists, etc.
            2. Write subroutines for solving the MAX-BANDWITH-PATH problem - Kruskal, Dijkstra's.
            3. Compare the performance of these routing protocols on randomly generated graphs.
